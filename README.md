# 🍓 Strawberry

**Strawberry** is a Roblox **LUAU** script that finds remote events that can be weaponized, giving the player **FE admin commands**.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Remote Event Scanner** – Detects vulnerable remote events/functions in real-time.
- 🛠️ **Weaponization Engine** – Automatically hooks and triggers exploitable remotes.
- 📜 **Multi Executor Support** – You can run this script on any level 3+ executor (e.g., `Solora`, `Xeno`, `Swift`, etc.).
- 🧠 **Command System** – Provides a suite of FE admin-style commands (e.g., `kill`, `freeze`, `bring`, etc.).
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** – Optimized for minimal lag and maximum performance.
- 🛡️ **Auto-Bypass Detection** – Avoids basic anti-exploit detection systems.

## 🧠 How It Works

Strawberry dynamically scans for **remote events/functions** exposed to the client. Once found, it attempts controlled invocations to test which ones respond to inputs and can be hijacked to run arbitrary server-side actions.
